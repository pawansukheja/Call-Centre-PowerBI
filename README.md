# Call-Centre-PowerBI

I'm delighted to announce the success of our recent project, the Call Center Performance Optimization initiative by PwC. Our objective was to revolutionize our client's call centre operations using data analytics, advanced insights, and industry best practices to drive measurable business outcomes and enhance overall customer experience.

Here are some key highlights from our dashboard:
‚úÖ Data Visualization: We transformed raw telecom data into actionable insights with visually appealing charts, graphs, and reports.
üìà KPI Focus: Our dashboard emphasizes crucial KPIs like customer satisfaction, call metrics, and agent performance, guiding strategic decision-making.
üé® Interactive Design: Users can dynamically explore telecom trends with filtering and data slicing capabilities.
üîê Data Security: Ensuring data security and privacy compliance was paramount throughout the project.
üåê Cross-Platform Access: The dashboard is accessible on Power BI Service, enabling seamless sharing and collaboration.
